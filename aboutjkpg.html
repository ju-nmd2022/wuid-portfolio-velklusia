        <p>Jönköping is a city in southern Sweden with 112,766 inhabitants. It is situated on the southern shore of Sweden's second largest lake, Vättern, in the province of Småland. Now it is also my new home for the upcoming 3 years. Jönköping has a special place in my heart that is why I wanted to show you my favourite attractions in town.

        <p>Amazing place for relaxing in nature, situated close to the city center. One of the best rose gardens in Sweden. I would recommend visiting it in late spring, summer or first part of September!

        <h5 class="mt-5 pt-4"> Vätterstrand</h5>
        <p>Several kilometers of sandy beach and large grassy areas in the middle of Jönköping. Jönköping's outdoor swimming area, really popular among locals. You can easily get to Vätterstranden on foot, by bicycle or by bus. It is also a perfect place for a picnic or a date.
