Klaudia has had a chance to gain knowledge in the field of marketing, branding, website management, as well as translations. She demonstrated strong language skills when creating translations, transcripts, and presentation scenarios. Klaudia can successfully work in foreign markets due to her friendly disposition and openness. Furthermore, Klaudia initiated the SEO implementation project at Digital Teammates - she was responsible for research, comparison of offers, selection of agencies, and subsequent cooperation with specialists. In two shakes of a lamb's tail, she can gain the skills and implement them into marketing strategies and activities. Business partners working with Klaudia indicate that her commitment, professionalism, willingness to develop, and communication methods stand out significantly and make the cooperation run in a pleasurable, executive professional, but very pro-human atmosphere. I am pleased to recommend Klaudia as a future employee. I think that her set of skills and character traits will be perfect for a project work environment that requires constant adaptation, changes, looking for solutions, and working with other people.</p>

She took the initiative to build and take over the management of the team of the group created on the Facebook channel as part of an international project. By managing the group on our channel, she set the directions for its development and contributed to the systematic and engaging activities of the recipients. As a result, the number of members of the Facebook group "Out with burn out" doubled in a short time. By taking the initiative to build a marketing team dedicated to this particular group, she contributed to the improvement of the organization's operations. Klaudia brought incredible energy to our team. She is a great leader and has highly developed soft skills, as evidenced by the fact that despite the short time of cooperation, she managed to build a great team. In her actions, Klaudia shows professionalism, responsibility and punctuality. The commitment shown from the first days of our cooperation is truly admirable.</p>
